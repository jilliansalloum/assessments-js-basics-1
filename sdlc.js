// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//using alt + up arrow, move the steps in the proper order

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
// create a variable for each step 
//set it equal to a string
//put the definition of the step in the string

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where you begin gathering all the specific details required for a new system as well as determining the first ideas for prototypes"

const design = "This is the third step, and developers will first outline the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects, such as its user interfaces, system interfaces, network / network requirements, and databases."

const implementation = "The fourth step is the part where developers actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications."

const testingAndIntegration = "The fifth step means that the code must be tested to make sure that there arent any bugs and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point."

const maintain = "The last step means that now it must be tested to make sure that there arent any bugs and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point."
